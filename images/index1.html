            <h1>LANA DEL RAY</h1>
            <h5>Artist</h5>
            <p>Elizabeth Grant was born on June 21, 1985, in Manhattan, New York City, to Robert England Grant Jr., a copywriter 
            at Grey Group, and Patricia Ann "Pat" (née Hill), an account executive at the same organization.
            She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant, and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.
            She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent.
            When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York. In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture
            company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;her mother worked as a schoolteacher.There, she 
            attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.
            In spring 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright
            Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title, Young Like Me, also listed. A second extended play,
            From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer. Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded 
            an acoustic album, Sirens, under the May Jailer project,which leaked on the internet in mid-2012.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans" to YouTube, featuring 
            vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam.The "Video Games" music video became a viral 
            internet sensation, which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single.
            She told The Observer: "I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't
            going to be the single but people have really responded to it." The song earned her a Q award for "Next Big Thing"
            in October 2011 and an Ivor Novello for "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012. In the same month, she signed a 
            joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die</p>

    <div><p>  Brought her ethereal Venus energy to the Coachella main stage as she closed out Friday night at the festival. 
        This marked her first Coachella performance since 2014. Seated on the back of a motorcycle, Del Rey rode serenely towards the
         stage with a full motorcade trailing behind her. Lines from her 2012 song “Jealous Girl” played from the speakers
         “Baby, I’m a gangster too/And it takes two to tango” — before she took the stage in a sparkling baby blue dress. Del Rey 
         commanded her set with a soft power, swanning among the ballerinas and aerial dancers as she sang ballads dating back to her
          earliest days; she demurely took a seat on a trapeze swing covered in flowers as she performed “Ride,” followed by “Born
           to Die.” . During a pre-Grammy event in February, the singer revealed that she’s dropping the record, titled Lasso, in
           September. (She did not mention this during her Friday night set.)herconflicting desire of being both seen and hidden, Del Rey
         exposes more than just who she is, but why she is who she is.”

      <div><p>Lana Del Rey and Quavo will release their new country-trap single “Tough” on July 3, the singers jointly announced Friday morning.

      <div><p>Del Rey and Quavo delivered the debut live performance of “Tough” last week during Del Rey’s headlining performance at Boston’s Fenway Park. The Atlanta rapper joined Del Rey to croon lines about being “tough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boot.”</p></div>

      <div><p>“Tough” is presumably a single from Del Rey’s incoming album titled “Lasso,” which she announced earlier this year during an appearance at Billboard’s pre-Grammy event in Los Angeles.</p></div>

      <div><p>After announcing a spoken word album in 2019, Del Rey released Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass and its corresponding spoken word album in 2020. The physical book was released on September 29 and the Jack Antonoff-produced audiobook on July 28. The spoken word poem "LA Who Am I to Love You" was released as the lead single the day before the album's release.</p></div>

      <div><p>Del Rey released her seventh studio album, Chemtrails over the Country Club, to critical acclaim. Announced in 2019, the album was originally slated for release in 2020 under the title White Hot Forevet but was postponed in November 2020 due to a delay in vinyl manufacturing. Like Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Chemtrails over the Country Club was mostly produced by Del Rey alongside Jack Antonoff.</p></div>
